                    <h2 id="about">About the Workshop</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the first workshop on Accessible Software Engineering. This workshop provides an
                        interdisciplinary venue for researchers and practitioners from software engineering,
                        human-computer interaction (HCI), computer science education, and other relevant fields to share
                        research, discuss ideas, and promote accessibility in software engineering. We plan to discuss
                        and advance the integration of and development for accessibility into all aspects of the
                        software engineering discipline.</p>
                    <p>This workshop will be utilized as a place for bringing together researchers to foster
                        interdisciplinary, collaborative discussions. A core goal of this workshop is to establish a
                        shared vocabulary for discussing disabilities within a software engineering context. We want all
                        attendees to be informed of an overview of accessibility principles, resource guides on
                        disability, and relevant global policies and legislation. To facilitate these goals, the
                        workshop will consist of various forms of research presentations, keynote talks, a panel, and
                        small group discussions designed to encourage deep engagement.</p>
                    <p>We hope this workshop will help attendees become familiar with ongoing research, identify
                        pressing research topics, and shape novel methodologies, tools, and best practices that
                        proactively ensure accessible software engineering environments and ensure that software is made
                        accessible.</p>
                    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                    <p>We welcome the attendance of anyone interested in making software engineering (the tools,
                        processes, practices, and policies) accessible to people with disabilities. Researchers,
                        practitioners, educators, and students are all encouraged to attend.</p>
                    <h2 id="cfp">Call for Papers</h2>
